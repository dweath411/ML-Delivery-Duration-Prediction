# ML-Delivery-Duration-Prediction
A DoorDash delivery duration prediction project, using multiple ML models, data visualization, analysis, and deep learning.

When a consumer places an order on DoorDash, we show the expected time of delivery. It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience.

## Goal
- Create machine learning model(s) to predict delivery duration in seconds. Be sure to explain: model(s) used, how I evaluated model performance on the historical data, any data processing, feature engineering choices made, and any other relevant information regarding the model.

## Methodology
- In order to achieve success in this project, we will employ two model types, linear regression and light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM). The performance metric used evaluated is the RMSE (root mean squared error), calculating the accuracy of predicted delivery duration.

### For viewing experience or if you want to run the notebook yourself, the only files you'll need are `historical_data.csv` and `main.ipynb`. The folder is just me using a different way (SWE style) to store the project. Since there are lots of dependencies it will not be a smooth process if you run it from the folder, and all code is not visible except in the notebook within the notebook folder.

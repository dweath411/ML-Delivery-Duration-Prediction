# ML-Delivery-Duration-Prediction
A DoorDash delivery duration prediction project, using multiple ML models, data visualization, analysis, and deep learning

When a consumer places an order on DoorDash, we show the expected time of delivery. It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience.

Goal: Create machine learning model(s) to predict delivery duration in seconds. Be sure to explain: model(s) used, how I evaluated model performance on the historical data, any data processing, feature engineering choices made, and any other relevant information regarding the model.

Methodology: In order to achieve success in this project, we will employ two model types, linear regression and light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM). The performance metric used evaluated is the RMSE (root mean squared error), calculating the accuracy of predicted delivery duration.
